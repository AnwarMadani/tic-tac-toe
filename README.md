# Tic-tac-toe Game

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with JavaScript. Players can take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, with the game detecting when a player wins or the game ends in a draw. The game features a simple and clean interface with smooth interactivity, highlighting the use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic. Itâ€™s a great demonstration of how to build a fun, interactive web application with minimal resources.
